This shows the differnt habit types and how many times they show up in the data.

This shows the relshinship between the min and max depth the fish was found in and the habit habit type.

Motivation: You should describe the question you set out to answer at the start of the project or
what led you to the specific dataset that you selected.

•Data Process: The centerpiece of your writeup should be a comprehensive discussion of your
process for sourcing, collecting, cleaning, and transforming the raw data into your final dataset. The
instructions should be clear enough that someone else could reproduce your process based on just the
ReadMe file to obtain the same final results. Note that this doesn’t necessarily have to be more than
a couple of sentences but it should be complete.
•Visualization: The ReadMe should contain at least one visualization summarizing the data. The
visualizations should follow the principles of good figure design and be sufficiently documented to
explain what they are demonstrating.
•Analysis: Finally, the ReadMe should describe the results of at least one method from this course
that you applied to the dataset and what you learned from it. This can be anything from a simple EDA
technique like identifying outliers, making a box plot of a column, evaluating the summary statistics
(Tukey’s 5 numbers), to one of the regression models from supervised learning, or one of the clustering
methods from unsupervised learning. This is not an exhaustive list of possibilities and as with the
previous components doesn’t need to be long or drawn out.
